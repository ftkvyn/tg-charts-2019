1. in terms of speed, especially when zooming out of graphs.
2. the graph headers are disproportionately smaller than the dark mode button. 
3. It is hardly necessary to support individual theme settings for each of the graphs – one button is more than enough.
4. We recommend using a relative scale so that lines on graphs can always occupy as much vertical space as possible. 
Note that lines “hang” on graphs three and five in your implementation.
5. It would be better to use rounded numbers on the Y-axis – the effect is especially noticeable on the final graph. 
For exact numbers, users can select a point on the graph.
6. It would be better for usability if scrolling the graphs didn't result in simultaneous vertical scrolling of the page.
